Also trained with the xception network.


The Xception network is incredibly powerful, correctly classifying all the cats (28) out of the set of 100. One problem with the set is classifying specific breeds and how the classifcications are somewhat ambiguous or classified poorly (lynx and tabby not having the term 'cat' in them)Â¶
